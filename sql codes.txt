Perfect, Ben â€” now that youâ€™ve opened the MySQL command prompt and logged in as root, hereâ€™s exactly what to type next to set up your Fashion Store inventory database:

ðŸ§± Step-by-Step SQL Commands
1. Create the database
CREATE DATABASE fashion_store;
USE fashion_store;


2. Create the inventory table
CREATE TABLE inventory (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  item_name VARCHAR(100),
  category VARCHAR(50),
  price DECIMAL(10,2),
  quantity_bought INT,
  quantity_sold INT DEFAULT 0
);


3. Insert sample items
INSERT INTO inventory (item_name, category, price, quantity_bought)
VALUES 
('Denim Jacket', 'Men', 45.00, 100),
('Floral Dress', 'Women', 35.00, 80),
('Kids T-shirt', 'Kids', 15.00, 120),
('Leather Handbag', 'Accessories', 60.00, 50);


4. View inventory status
SELECT 
  item_name,
  category,
  price,
  quantity_bought,
  quantity_sold,
  (quantity_bought - quantity_sold) AS in_stock,
  (quantity_sold * price) AS revenue
FROM inventory;



ðŸ§® Optional: Update sales manually
UPDATE inventory SET quantity_sold = quantity_sold + 1 WHERE item_name = 'Denim Jacket';

î·™î·š

Once youâ€™ve run these, your database is live and tracking inventory, sales, and revenue. Let me know if you want to export this as a .sql file or connect it to your PHP site â€” Iâ€™ll walk you through it.
